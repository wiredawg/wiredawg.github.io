<div class="post-title">A Workout Plan Based On The Stations of the Cross For Lent</div>

This is an exercise plan I developed for my fitness group during Lent. We meet at 5am on Saturdays
near a church in my town and do our workouts at different parks and sites nearby.

<div class="text-center">**NOTE**: "coupons" refer to either a log/natural coupon (there is driftwood by the park) or jugs of water/sand.</div><br/>

# Warmups

_Stations 1-3_

**The First Station:** `Pilate Condemns Jesus to Die`

> 'Pilate'... in Latin 'Pill-ah-toe'... sounds like 'Pilates' to me! So we will borrow from BabyRuth and open with a 
> few core exercises.

**The Second Station:** `Jesus Accepts His Cross`

> Circle up and pass the coupons around the circle for 1 minute. 1 curl each arm then pass
> to the left.

**The Third Station:** `Jesus Falls the First Time`

> Like Burpees but sit ups. Controlled fall to your rear, sit up, recover to feet and repeat.

# Pair Exercises

_Stations 4-8_

**The Fourth Station:** `Jesus Meets His Afflicted Mother`

> Inspired by this gesture of compassion, the PAX team up now. Count off/Pair Up.

**The Fifth Station:** `Simon Helps Jesus Carry the Cross`

> As pairs, one PAX stands at the basketball court with the coupon. The other down 
> range toward the swingset. The PAX at the court runs with coupon to the other PAX while 
> that PAX is doing merkins.
> Upon arrival, PAX 2 collects the coupon and runs to the court. While PAX 1 does merkins.
> When PAX 2 arrives at the court they enter into planks until all are back in place.
> Repeat.

**The Sixth Station:** `Veronica Offers Her Vail To Jesus`

> We will offer up some supported Merkins as a pair. Rest your legs on each other do 20 Merkins.

**The Seventh Station:** `Jesus Falls The Second Time`

> Burpees!
> While partner crosses the court back and forths doing lazy inch worms.

**The Eigth Station:** `Jesus Speaks to the Women`

> Assisted bear crawls, aka Wheelbarrows. Pair up. BBall court side-to-side one way then
> switch. At half-court. 5 Dirkins since you're already in that position anyway...

# Team Exercises

_Stations 9-14_: Organize into two teams

**The Ninth Station:** `Jesus Falls The Third Time`

Honoring the journey their Lord took with the cross, the PAX will make these stairs their _Scala Sancta_
(Holy Stairs).

> Line up as two teams on either side of the middle hand rail. Each PAX must bear crawl up the
> stairs carrying the coupon with them. Once at the top they safely walk it down to the next PAX
> in line. Proceed to alternate between planks and baby crunches until all are finished. First team
> to complete wins and gets to take a break in the next station.

**The Tenth Station:** `Jesus Is Stripped Of His Garments`

> Out of respect for their Lord, their dignity, and to avoid scandal the PAX will use this 
> time to reflect upon their humility and appreciate the comforts they enjoy in their lives.
> 30 seconds of silent Thinkers.

**The Eleventh Station:** `Jesus Is Nailed To the Cross`

_They stretched out his <u>arms</u> and nailed them to the cross._

> Taking turns holding the coupon out at yourside, first team to elevate at 90 degress
> for 100 seconds wins. You may assist your team mate but don't take away the challenge.

**The Twelfth Station:** `Jesus Dies Upon The Cross`

> The PAX perform a 1 minute silent Thinker to reflect upon their Lord's passion.

**The Thirteenth Station:** `Jesus Is Taken Down From The Cross`

> Teams line up on their six length wise along the court. Lying on
> their backs they pass the coupon from the back of the line to the
> from. PAX in the rear must get up and move to the front. First
> team to the other end of the court wins.

**The Fourteenth Station:** `Jesus Is Placed In The Sepulcher`

> The PAX return any natural coupons to their original resting places.

# Prayer to Jesus Christ Crucified

My good and dear Jesus, I kneel before You, asking You most earnestly to
engrave upon my heart a deep and lively faith, hope, and charity, with true
repentance for my sins, and a firm resolve to make amends.  As I reflect upon
Your five wounds, and dwell upon them with deep compassion and grief, I recall,
good Jesus, the words the Prophet David spoke long ago concerning
Yourself: 

> _“They pierced My hands and My feet; they have numbered all My bones.”_
