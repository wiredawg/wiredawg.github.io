It is hard to argue with the logic presented by St. Blaze Pascal in
his discussion on the ["Belief in God Wager"](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/pascal-wager/).

To summarize his treatise, a 2-bit binary truth table can be used:

# Pascal's Wager
|  G  |  B  | Result     |
|:---:|:---:|:-----------|
|  0  |  0  | No Effect  |
|  0  |  1  | Lived Good |
|  1  |  0  | Damnation  |
|  1  |  1  | Salvation  |

There's no reason not to have faith.
