It is hard to argue with the logic presented by St. Blaze Pascal in
his discussion on the ["Belief in God Wager"](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/pascal-wager/).

To summarize his treatise, a 2-bit binary truth table can be used:

# Pascal's Wager
|  G  |  B  | Result     |
|:---:|:---:|:-----------|
|  0  |  0  | No Effect  |
|  0  |  1  | Lived Good |
|  1  |  0  | Damnation  |
|  1  |  1  | Salvation  |

By this logic, it is within reason to believe in God. Faith is not contrary to reason. To further develop
this idea we can turn to St. Thomas Aquinas and look at three mistakes that he cites when the
issue of Faith vs. Reason arises:

The 3 Mistakes:

  1. Skepticism - Says that faith is irrational because it cannot be proved. Or
                  science has disproved religion (somehow, there is no evidence of that
                  either).
  2. Fideism - Agrees that faith is opposed to reason but affirms that faith is all you need.
  3. Subjectivism - Faith is purely personal and interior

St. Thomas argues that faith and reason are not in conflict because they are
both seeking a fundamental unity of truth based on the order of reality.

Cannot have something that is true according to faith and at the same time
false according to reason.

Truth is not subjective, private, or personal. Truth is based on reality.

When we derive truths from others, by trusting what they say, we rely on the
Signs of Credibility in their message. These signs show the rational marks that
allow us to accept the truth.

Because God is that fundamental Unity sought by faith and reason it only makes
sense that He is the source of reality (of all that exists).

Thus He must also then be the source of reason (and of faith and revelation).

But, How again do we /know/ that God is the source of reality?  By definition
of reason: God is not a created being, some “old man in the clouds“. God is
that which nothing can be greater is greater.

By definition of faith: Per Aquinas and Catholic teaching, the church claims
that the signs of credibility are provided by examples such as Jesus’ miracles
and the enduring presence of the church through time.

So it must be up to us to accept these claimed signs of credibility and thus
accept them willfully as truths without any tangible proof. Thus we must have
faith in them. They are mysteries and cannot be proven by natural reason.

Is this reasonable, to accept that there is natural reason AND supernatural
reason (a.k.a the supernatural light of faith)?  … rather, is faith reasonable?

Faith may not be what you think it is. Consider how in physics either
kinematics or energy can be used to determine the end result of a physical
process. Think of faith and reason in this way. Both seek the same result. Both
employ similar mechanisms (thought). They just accomplish the same thing in
different ways. Similarly you cannot have one without the other because faith
without reason is blind and reason without faith is futile.  So it seems that
faith is reasonable.

> “Understood this way, there is no opposition between the doctrine of creation ex nihilo and modern Big Bang cosmology. They examine the same reality from two different, non-competitive perspectives.”

> “…truths which man can hope to know fully in the ultimate state of human perfection”

Can you label a claim as Truth and then explain it cannot be proven by natural reason?
“Look, there’s no way to prove it. Just trust me. Look at these other reasons why you should. Are those reasons not credible?”

Belief can be ascribed to an act of obedience to a higher authority.  It requires an active and conscience decision of the will to accept the claims that cannot be proven by natural reason.

Some truths can be known in this life but 5 reasons point to the necessity of faith:

  1. Eccles. 7:25 said: “It is a great depth, who shall find it out?” Thus, the depth and subtly of the claim may not make it apparent to us
  2. The human intellect is not perfect, compared with God, and we cannot comprehend all things
  3. Since divine truth is the “end” of all sciences, it would be necessary to understand all the sciences to understand the truth
  4. Due to man’s natural constitution, intellectual investigation is limited (how is this different than #2?)
  5. Because man is too busy trying to stay alive, and their lives are short, they would be unable to learn everything required to understand all things

So the claim here is that Faith is a replacement for these limitations — Is. 7:9 said “Unless thou hadst believed, thou wouldst not understand.”
