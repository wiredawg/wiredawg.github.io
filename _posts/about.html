# About Me

## What is a `wiredawg`?

A "Wire Dawg" is the name given to telecommunication technicians in the U.S.
Military. There used to be a vibrant online presence at `wiredawg.net` where
one could learn more and see the work that these folks have done all over
the world. But that site shutdown in the late 2000s. So I name this project
in honor of all those whom for decades installed and maintained the
most wide-spread analog telephony network on Earth.

## Who am I?

I'm not big in sharing personal specifics online. I'm a former Air Force telecom
tech. Current computer engineer. With a wide range of interests that have varied 
over the years.

I just like spending time with my family, teaching people the things I have learned over
the years, and learning from those far smarter than I.
