As I stated below, I'm (still) part of a fitness group of guys who meet every Saturday at 0500 in the gloom,
rain or shine, hot or cold. We take turns leading the workouts. 
Here I document another excersize I have led, for future reference so I can just look at my phone during the workout and
also so others may reference it later...
