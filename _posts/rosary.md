# Paracord Rosaries

<center><img src="/images/rosaries-20220820.jpg" width="50%" /></center>

A hobby that I have developed in the past couple of years is assembling durable rosaries from
paracord and wooden beads.

At the moment I am only going to document my materials here but in the future I hope I build out
this page into a tutorial as well. 

[Gallery](/pages/rosary_gallery.html)

## One Rosary Summary

This summary describes my standard rosary:

  - 6ft of paracord (core removed if using HomeDepot's multicam paracord)
  - 53 10mm beads with 4mm holes
  - 6 10-12mm metal beads with 4-5mm holes for the four mystery beads, the Pater Noster bead, and the Gloria bead
  - 1 2-2.5inch Cruxifix
  - 1 Saint medal
  - 1 3mm metal ring to hold the Saint medal

## Models

After some time experimenting and I have settled on a few favorites that seem to be popular amoung those
who I have gives these to as gifts. Here I will describe them. I do not have any thoughtful names for these
and generally the cruixifix and saint medals are not fixed to any model. The biggest differences between 
the models are the type of cord and beads.

### Type 1

<img src="/images/Rosaries/IMG_0890-sm.jpg" width="40%" />
<img src="/images/Rosaries/IMG_0891-sm.jpg" width="40%" />

This type comes with multicam paracord and either light or dark coffee beads.

- Rosary cord: [Home Depot's EverBilt Multicam Rope - 75ft @ $6](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Everbilt-5-32-in-x-75-ft-Camouflage-Diamond-Braid-Polypropylene-Rope-with-Winder-72575/206094286)
- Ave beads: [10mmx9mm wooden beads - 900pcs @$10](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09VPJSXZP/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o03_s01?ie=UTF8&psc=1)
- Mystery beads: "Michael's metal beads"

### Type 2

<img src="/images/Rosaries/IMG_0892-sm.jpg" width="40%" />

This type of rosary has a smaller cord (1-2mm) and usually a little extra room between the beads with more naturally colored wooden beads.

- Rosary cord: Black "Micro" paracord, sometimes labelled "90 cord" instead of "550 cord" with sizes between 1.18mm and 2mm.
- Ave beads: [10mm natuarally dyed beads](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08M6C2T9F/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o07_s01?ie=UTF8&psc=1)
- Mystery beads: "Michael's metal beads"  

### Other Types

I have experimented with many other combinations but have not formally specified any mostly because
materials are not stable, expecially materals from Amazon.

You can look at the gallery to see other rosaries.

## Cord

  - 75ft 550 multicam cord
    - <strike>Get the US made not the Chinese as it is far worse quality. I buy these in person to make sure they are good material</strike>
    - Home Depot near me only carries the Chinese version now. There are two kind the one on the winder and one that is
      only wound up. The one on the winder I link below, it seems pretty solid. The other feels like plastic.
    - [Home Depot - $6](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Everbilt-5-32-in-x-75-ft-Camouflage-Diamond-Braid-Polypropylene-Rope-with-Winder-72575/206094286)
