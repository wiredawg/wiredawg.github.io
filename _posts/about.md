# About Me

## "Tin Can Report"? What is a `wiredawg`?

To begin with, a "Wire Dawg" is the name given to telecommunication technicians
in the U.S.  Military. There used to be a vibrant online presence at
`wiredawg.net` where one could learn more and see the work these technicians
have done all over the world: from swamps in Florida to under barracks in the
desert of Qatar. But that site shutdown in the late 2000s. I name this website
in honor of all those whom for decades installed and maintained the most
wide-spread analog telephony network on Earth.

Tin Can is a reference to the old science experiment of connecting tin cans together
by a length of wire to act as a rudimentary analog telephone. "Tin Can" is also
the call sign humbily bestowed upon me in [F3](www.f3nation.com).

## Who am I?

For starters, with respect to the name of this site, I am a former Air Force
telecommunications technician who since has moved on to explore other areas of technology from
logically describing the behavior of the transistor arrangements inside of a microprocessor
to writing code that automatically controls a lawnmower, to databases and web applications.

In recent years, through the movements of someone far greater than any of us, I have come
to learn the truth in St. Augustine's famous quote:

> "_Our hearts are restless until they rest in God._"

I have discovered the vast depth of knowledge provided by the intellectual tradition of the 
Catholic faith. In my journey to find meaning in life, as I grow older, I have come to rely
upon the deep wisdom provided by saints like:

  - [Isidore of Seville](https://www.amazon.com/Isidore-Sevilles-Etymologies-Complete-Translation/dp/1411665236),
    who showed to me great scholastic disipline can be attained while at the same time leading his flock as a powerful Bishop.
  - [Josemaria Escriva](https://www.ewtn.com/catholicism/saints/josemaria-escriva-654), who teaches me how to life life while
    remaining on the path toward objective meaning.
  - [Benedict of Nursia](http://www.osb.org/), for his establishment of disiplined prayer
  - [Thomas Aquinas](https://aquinas101.thomisticinstitute.org/), for his unparalleled application of reason who has made
    for me a realization that faith and reason are not opposed to each other and has allowed me to formulate convincing notions of
    religious topics.
  - Ignatius of Antioch, for his contrinutions to the early records of the church and the truely Catholic foundation found in those
    early days.
  - [Pope John Paul II](https://tobinstitute.org/), for his Theology of the Body
  - [Pope Benedict XVI](https://www.vatican.va/content/benedict-xvi/en.html), for his deeply
    theological insights and [recognition of the beauty of sacred tradition](https://www.ccwatershed.org/).
  - [Fr. Georges Lemaitre](https://blog.magiscenter.com/blog/fr.-georges-lemaitre-father-of-the-big-bang-theory), who proved
    to me in a very practical way that the tradition's reliance on reason is founded in nature itself.

Finally, I just like spending time with my family, teaching people the things I have learned over
the years, and learning from those far smarter than I (_Which is basically everyone_).
