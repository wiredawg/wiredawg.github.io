# About Me

## "Tin Can Report"? What is a `wiredawg`?

To begin with, a "Wire Dawg" is the name given to telecommunication technicians
in the U.S.  Military. There used to be a vibrant online presence at
`wiredawg.net` where one could learn more and see the work these technicians
have done all over the world: from swamps in Florida to under barracks in the
desert of Qatar. But that site shutdown in the late 2000s. I name this website
in honor of all those whom for decades installed and maintained the most
wide-spread analog telephony network on Earth.

Tin Can is a reference to the old science experiment of connecting tin cans together
by a length of wire to act as a rudimentary analog telephone. "Tin Can" is also
the call sign humbily bestowed upon me in [F3](www.f3nation.com).

## Who am I?

For starters, with respect to the name of this site, I am a former Air Force
telecommunications technician who since has moved on to explore other areas of technology from
logically describing the behavior of the transistor arrangements inside of a microprocessor
to writing code that automatically controls a lawnmower, to databases and web applications.

Finally, I just like spending time with my family, teaching people the things I have learned over
the years, and learning from those far smarter than I (_Which is basically everyone_).
