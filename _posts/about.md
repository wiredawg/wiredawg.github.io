# About Me

## What is a `wiredawg`?

A "Wire Dawg" is the name given to telecommunication technicians in the U.S.
Military. There used to be a vibrant online presence at `wiredawg.net` where
one could learn more and see the work that these folks have done all over
the world. But that site shutdown in the late 2000s. So I name this project
in honor of all those whom for decades installed and maintained the
most wide-spread analog telephony network on Earth.

## Who am I?

That's hard to describe. For one, I'm not big in sharing personal specifics online.
I also agree that we should not define ourselves by our careers. There is so much 
more to us. But alas, with respect to the name of this site, I am a former Air Force
telecommunications techician who since has moved on to explore other areas of technology from
logically describing the behavior of the transistor arrangements inside of a microprocessor
to writing code that automatically controls a lawnmower, to databases and web applications.

In recent years, through the movements of someone far greater than any of us, I have come
to learn the truth in St. Augustine's famous quote:

> "_Our hearts are restless until they rest in God._"

Finally, I just like spending time with my family, teaching people the things I have learned over
the years, and learning from those far smarter than I (_Which is basically everyone_).
