# [Luke 16:34](http://www.drbo.org/cgi-bin/d?b=drl&bk=49&ch=12&l=16-#x)

Luke 16 begins a parable about those whom store up their riches can deprive so
many of needed resources and create such a deep inequality within the society
(especially when this type of selfishness applies to a large number within the
community). We see this for sure today. I am guilty of this for sure. I move
through life with boxes full of items I consider to be junk which may help one
in need of that item. I keep a watchful eye on the stock market to see how my
retirement outlook is. I store away a portion of my salary into a savings
account in case of an emergency. And yet,
I always seem convinced that this is fine. These "funds" are in a system,
not stored up inaccessible to others and this junk is not really useful to
anyone. They would do so much better with new products and not this old
used item.

But what does our reliance on these systems say about us. It is really
a reflection of our societies rejection of God. We build up vast
financial systems and call them the foundations of our economy in order
to give us the illusion of reliance on ourselves. This product of the 
Enlightenment movement is yet another example of how we as a culture 
have attempted to place ourself above God and to make us independent of Him. 

But what does it mean to be independent of God? To be self reliant? To
be free of God's Law?

...Is that not the same as separation from God, which is the definition of sin?

...And what then is God if not the reality of good, truth, and beauty. Why would we 
want to separate ourselves from that?

As we strive for self-reliance, to place our trust in creation, and to hold an
illusion of independence, we fall from grace and get 
lost in the darkness. 

[Plato's allegory of the cave in his "The Republic"](https://www.thoughtco.com/the-allegory-of-the-cave-120330)
(<small>[source](http://classics.mit.edu/Plato/republic.mb.txt)</small>)
remains immensely applicable today as it did back then. We very much prefer the
flicker shadows on the walls of the cave. They allure us. They distract us.
They seem to excuse us from our duties. All the while the source of light creating those shadows
shines forth at the mouth of that cave. It beacons us to get up and walk out, to see and to return and share
the news and bring others out. But even as we realize this and desire to leave the cave, we find ourselves stuck
in a world resisting us. This is our crab mentality, now, just as it was in Plato's time.
