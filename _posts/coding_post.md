I wrote up a page about many of the lessons learned I have had in a career as a
computer engineer. Things like setting up your development environment and identifying
how much time you can waste doing this, to managing your priorities in your projects.
I hope to cover a variety of topics overtime. So this post is just a bookmark for that
page and I hope to add to that page as I have time: [Coding Skills](/pages/coding.html)

Most of what I'll put there will be references to what others have already posted elsewhere
on the internet, but maybe what I add of my own experiences will be useful to someone.
