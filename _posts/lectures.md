In this post I record several lectures that have had an impact on how I finally formulated 
my perpective on life. They assisted me in articulating the impact of our societal context
has had on my development. They peeled away the vail of ignorance about why I behaved one
way or another and how others fall to similar and unrelated pits.

## Love

Once I understood the concept of Concupiscience, I started to understand myself and my captivity
to my desires. This lecture by Dr. R.J. Snell that was given at Princeton in February of 2020
provides a perspective on Concupiscience on how it compares to the other forms of love.

Speaking of forms of love, I have found it useful to be aware that love is not equal and love
is not just a feeling. Love, is verb, and in it's most ordered and good form is an act of 
giving of ones self to others. Love is not expecting to receieve something. The ancient
Greeks knew this, we have all but forgot this: Beneviolent, Eros, Philial, Agape.

Consider how the ending of the Gospel of John closes with our Lord's three time petition
of Peter's love. In [English](https://www.drbo.org/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=21&l=16-#x):

> He saith to him again: Simon, son of John, lovest thou me? He saith to him:
> Yea, Lord, thou knowest that I love thee. He saith to him: Feed my lambs.
> He said to him the third time: Simon, son of John, lovest thou me? Peter was
> grieved, because he had said to him the third time: Lovest thou me? And he
> said to him: Lord, thou knowest all things: thou knowest that I love thee.

If you look at the original [Greek of these words](https://biblehub.com/interlinear/john/21.htm)
you will observe that this exchange involved different words for love throughout. In summary, it was like
this: the first and second petitions, Jesus asked with the word "Agapas", Peter responded with the word "Philo".
Here, Jesus asks Peter if he loves him in the highest form but Peter responds with a lower
form of love, that of a friend.

In the final petition, Jesus lowers His expectation and asks Peter with the word "Philo", matching
Peter's responses and showing mercy and acceptance to His apostle.

## Faith

Ever hear anyone say, "I'm spiritual, but not religious". This lecture given at Yale in September
of 2021 by Dr. R.J. Snell provides invaluable insight into this chaotic ideology:
