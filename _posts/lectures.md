## The real 'woke' that men need to experience

I admit it. I grew up in a comfy middle class family and although my parents 
provided a number of oppurtunities to develop my ability to handle responsibility, 
I never fully embraced those experiences. Maturity level was a factor but mostly
I believe that I was not pushed to deal with the hard things in life.
I was occupied mainly on myself and my own whims and desires.
This is a very common among American youth and has had the effect of
essentially producing a generation of effeminate males. 

> Note, being effeminate has nothing to do with femininity or gender roles or anything like that.
> Rather, it describes someone who is so attentive to their own desires and who
> has no self control over the responses to their 'feelings'. They prefer to base
> their decisions on how something will make them feel rather than discerning
> with logic the choices they should make. They consume and use no prudence in
> their moral actions. Its so common to see these days, so common in fact that
> the term "Man Child" is what our culture uses to identify it.

By the grace of God (through a loving wife that challenges me to be a bigger
man) I have come to be aware of this state. And aware of it, I now
observe other men that are also _waking_ up to this in their own lives. Many
are struggling while some are developing ways to combat it. Knowing is half the
battle, so in this post I record several lectures that have had an impact on how
I came to formulate a perspective on this reality in my life. These lectures have
assisted me in articulating the impacts that our society's acceptance of these
lifestyle choices have had on my development. These talks have peeled away the
vail of ignorance about why I behaved one way or another.

Although these talks have a very faith based foundation, I would find it hard
for even the most learned atheist to argue that their reasoning and goals are
fruitless. There are so many self-help programs and guru's out here right now
but the truths and challenges built up by two thousand years of pastoral care in
Christ's church reveal time tested techniques for living a more ordered and
fulfilling life. So even if you do not ascent to the mystery of faith, you
can ascent to an ordered life. A life lived justly and without iniquity and 
I cannot image anyone with a reasonable mentality would argue for anything else.

//EXPAND

**NOTE:** I mean to expand this list to include more authors. In honor of the day
I am writing this being January 28th, the feast day of St. Thomas Aquinas, 
I have started with Dr. R.J. Snell's talks that I find most interesting but hope to include others.
Dr. R.J. Snell's talks are featured by the [Thomistic Institue](https://thomisticinstitute.org/)
which is a work produced by the Dominican Friars living in Washington D.C.
Another speaker known to work with the T.I. is Dr. Karin Oberg I will include her
talks which help provide an understanding of how order can be found in the greater universe.
More speakers I may post about are Fr. David Dufresne for a perspective on manhood and being Christ-like to others,
and even (of all things) a [rapper](https://www.youtube.com/@e-knock6826)
who's messages so very much resonate with the topics of this post.

## Acedia

Anyone stuck in a perpetual WFH career can relate to these talks:

 - [Acedia and the Bleaching of Being](https://soundcloud.com/thomisticinstitute/acedia-and-the-bleaching-of-being-dr-rj-snell)
 - [Acedia, the Forgotten Capital Sin](https://www.catholicculture.org/commentary/episode-18-acedia-forgotten-capital-sin-rj-snell/)

Discovering the notion of acedia (pronounced ah-che-dee-ah (ecclesial) or ah-cee-dee-ah (classical))
and its effects in my life has been essential in helping me recognize how poorly
I use my time. And not only that, but also how the way's in which I waste my time
introduce disorder into my life. These details are personal and different for
everyone but listen to these talks and you will quickly see how you can better
assess your actions throughout the day. 

This is not a self-help guide or a recipe for success but rather assistance in
developing the mentality of purposeful living.

## Love

Once I understood the concept of Concupiscence, I started to understand myself and my captivity
to my desires. This lecture by Dr. R.J. Snell that was given at Princeton in February of 2020
provides a perspective on Concupiscence on how it compares to the other forms of love.

[Demons at the Feast of Love: Concupiscence, Benevolence, and Transcendence](https://soundcloud.com/thomisticinstitute/demons-at-the-feast-of-love-concupiscence-benevolence-and-transcendence)

Speaking of forms of love, I have found it useful to be aware that love is not equal and love
is not just a feeling. Love, is verb, and in it's most ordered and good form is an act of 
giving of ones self to others. Love is not expecting to receive something. The ancient
Greeks knew this, we have all but forgot this: Eros, Filial, Agape (Benevolence).

Consider how the ending of the Gospel of John closes with our Lord's three time petition
of Peter's love. In [English](https://www.drbo.org/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=21&l=16-#x):

> He saith to him again: Simon, son of John, lovest thou me? He saith to him:
> Yea, Lord, thou knowest that I love thee. He saith to him: Feed my lambs.
> He said to him the third time: Simon, son of John, lovest thou me? Peter was
> grieved, because he had said to him the third time: Lovest thou me? And he
> said to him: Lord, thou knowest all things: thou knowest that I love thee.

If you look at the original [Greek of these words](https://biblehub.com/interlinear/john/21.htm)
you will observe that this exchange involved different words for love throughout. In summary, it was like
this: the first and second petitions, Jesus asked with the word "Agapas", Peter responded with the word "Philo".
Here, Jesus asks Peter if he loves him in the highest form but Peter responds with a lower
form of love, that of a friend.

In the final petition, Jesus lowers His expectation and asks Peter with the word "Philo", matching
Peter's responses and showing mercy and acceptance to His apostle.

## Faith

Ever hear anyone say, "I'm spiritual, but not religious". This lecture given at Yale in September
of 2021 by Dr. R.J. Snell provides invaluable insight into this chaotic ideology:
