I used to have a 1hr one-way commute and as a result I was a big listener of podcasts and audio books. Since 
I recently shared some of my favorite with a friend I decided to post them here
so I could share with others more easily.

I have these grouped into categories depending on topic and provide a short summary for each.

## Catholic Podcasts

As I am an adult convert to the Catholic Faith, I sought many resources during my conversion
to help guide and form my understanding of the faith. Being an engineer and generally a logic
and reason based guy, I found that I had to do a lot of research before I could really 
accept God into my life. After that, I had to find which religion and church made the most
sense. The following podcasts where great suppliments in this search but only a fragment
in my greater journey that led me to where I am today.



## Tech Podcasts

My early podcast consumption primarily comprised of shows focused on software development
and later expanded into general technology interests like information security. Here are
some of the podcasts that I enjoyed in this regard.
