I used to have a 1hr one-way commute and as a result I was a big listener of podcasts and audio books. Since 
I recently shared some of my favorite with a friend I decided to post them here
so I could share with others more easily.

I have these grouped into categories depending on topic and provide a short summary for each.

## Catholic Podcasts

As I am an adult convert to the Catholic Faith, I sought many resources during my conversion
to help guide and form my understanding of the faith. Being an engineer and generally a logic
and reason based guy, I found that I had to do a lot of research before I could really 
accept God into my life. After that, I had to find which religion and church made the most
sense. The following podcasts where great suppliments in this search but only a fragment
in my greater journey that led me to where I am today.

[**The Catholic Talk Show**](https://catholictalkshow.com/)

> Three knowlegable and guys with great comraderie discussion popular topics of Catholicism. Surface level and some deep dives but
> geared for your average person.

> A monestary in France streaming their daily hours of the Divine Office. This is the Monastic office of St. Benedict which
> very closely aligns with the texts in the Monastic Diurnale. See: [my write up on the divine office](/misc/loth.html)
