    <h1>About Me</h1>

<h2>"Tin Can Report"? What is a <code>wiredawg</code>?</h2>

<p>To begin with, a "Wire Dawg" is the name given to telecommunication technicians
in the U.S.  Military. There used to be a vibrant online presence at
<code>wiredawg.net</code> where one could learn more and see the work these technicians
have done all over the world: from swamps in Florida to under barracks in the
desert of Qatar. But that site shutdown in the late 2000s. I name this website
in honor of all those whom for decades installed and maintained the most
wide-spread analog telephony network on Earth.</p>

<p>Tin Can is a reference to the old science experiment of connecting tin cans together
by a length of wire to act as a rudimentary analog telephone. "Tin Can" is also
the call sign humbily bestowed upon me in <a href="www.f3nation.com">F3</a>.</p>

<h2>Who am I?</h2>

<p>For starters, with respect to the name of this site, I am a former Air Force
telecommunications technician who since has moved on to explore other areas of technology from
logically describing the behavior of the transistor arrangements inside of a microprocessor
to writing code that automatically controls a lawnmower, to databases and web applications.</p>

<p>In recent years, through the movements of someone far greater than any of us, I have come
to learn the truth in St. Augustine's famous quote:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"<em>Our hearts are restless until they rest in God.</em>"</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I have discovered the vast depth of knowledge provided by the intellectual tradition of the 
Catholic faith. In my journey to find meaning in life, as I grow older, I have come to rely
upon the deep wisdom provided by saints like:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Isidore-Sevilles-Etymologies-Complete-Translation/dp/1411665236">Isidore of Seville</a>,
who showed to me great scholastic disipline can be attained while at the same time leading his flock as a powerful Bishop.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.ewtn.com/catholicism/saints/josemaria-escriva-654">Josemaria Escriva</a>, who teaches me how to live life while
remaining on the path toward objective meaning.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.osb.org/">Benedict of Nursia</a>, for his establishment of disiplined prayer</li>
<li><a href="https://aquinas101.thomisticinstitute.org/">Thomas Aquinas</a>, for his unparalleled application of reason who has made
for me a realization that faith and reason are not opposed to each other and has allowed me to formulate convincing notions of
religious topics.</li>
<li>Ignatius of Antioch, for his contrinutions to the early records of the church and the truely Catholic foundation found in those
early days.</li>
<li><a href="https://tobinstitute.org/">Pope John Paul II</a>, for his Theology of the Body</li>
<li><a href="https://www.vatican.va/content/benedict-xvi/en.html">Pope Benedict XVI</a>, for his deeply
theological insights and <a href="https://www.ccwatershed.org/">recognition of the beauty of sacred tradition</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://blog.magiscenter.com/blog/fr.-georges-lemaitre-father-of-the-big-bang-theory">Fr. Georges Lemaitre</a>, who proved
to me in a very practical way that the tradition's reliance on reason is founded in nature itself.</li>
</ul>

<p>Finally, I just like spending time with my family, teaching people the things I have learned over
the years, and learning from those far smarter than I (<em>Which is basically everyone</em>).</p>
