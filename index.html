            <h2>The real 'woke' that men need to experience</h2>

<p>I admit it. I grew up in a comfy middle class family and although my parents 
provided a number of oppurtunities to develop my ability to handle responsibility, 
I never fully embraced those experiences. Maturity level was a factor but mostly
I believe that I was not pushed to deal with the hard things in life.
I was occupied mainly on myself and my own whims and desires.
This is a very common among American youth and has had the effect of
essentially producing a generation of effeminate males. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Note, being effeminate has nothing to do with femininity or gender roles or anything like that.
  Rather, it describes someone who is so attentive to their own desires and who
  has no self control over the responses to their 'feelings'. They prefer to base
  their decisions on how something will make them feel rather than discerning
  with logic the choices they should make. They consume and use no prudence in
  their moral actions. Its so common to see these days, so common in fact that
  the term "Man Child" is what our culture uses to identify it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>By the grace of God (through a loving wife that challenges me to be a bigger
man) I have come to be aware of this state. And aware of it, I now
observe other men that are also <em>waking</em> up to this in their own lives. Many
are struggling while some are developing ways to combat it. Knowing is half the
battle, so in this post I record several lectures that have had an impact on how
I came to formulate a perspective on this reality in my life. These lectures have
assisted me in articulating the impacts that our society's acceptance of these
lifestyle choices have had on my development. These talks have peeled away the
vail of ignorance about why I behaved one way or another.</p>

<p>Although these talks have a very faith based foundation, I would find it hard
for even the most learned atheist to argue that their reasoning and goals are
fruitless. There are so many self-help programs and guru's out here right now
but the truths and challenges built up by two thousand years of pastoral care in
Christ's church reveal time tested techniques for living a more ordered and
fulfilling life. So even if you do not ascent to the mystery of faith, you
can ascent to an ordered life. A life lived justly and without iniquity and 
I cannot image anyone with a reasonable mentality would argue for anything else.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Faith is the realization of what is hoped for and evidence of things not seen. (HEB 11)</p>

<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> I mean to expand this list to include more authors. In honor of the day
I am writing this being January 28th, the feast day of St. Thomas Aquinas, 
I have started with Dr. R.J. Snell's talks that I find most interesting but hope to include others.
Dr. R.J. Snell's talks are featured by the <a href="https://thomisticinstitute.org/">Thomistic Institue</a>
which is a work produced by the Dominican Friars living in Washington D.C.
Another speaker known to work with the T.I. is Dr. Karin Oberg I will include her
talks which help provide an understanding of how order can be found in the greater universe.
More speakers I may post about are Fr. David Dufresne for a perspective on manhood and being Christ-like to others,
and even (of all things) a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@e-knock6826">rapper</a>
who's messages so very much resonate with the topics of this post.</p>

<h2>Acedia</h2>

<p>Anyone stuck in a perpetual WFH career can relate to these talks:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://soundcloud.com/thomisticinstitute/acedia-and-the-bleaching-of-being-dr-rj-snell">Acedia and the Bleaching of Being</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.catholicculture.org/commentary/episode-18-acedia-forgotten-capital-sin-rj-snell/">Acedia, the Forgotten Capital Sin</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Discovering the notion of acedia (pronounced ah-che-dee-ah (ecclesial) or ah-cee-dee-ah (classical))
and its effects in my life has been essential in helping me recognize how poorly
I use my time. And not only that, but also how the way's in which I waste my time
introduce disorder into my life. These details are personal and different for
everyone but listen to these talks and you will quickly see how you can better
assess your actions throughout the day. </p>

<p>This is not a self-help guide or a recipe for success but rather assistance in
developing the mentality of purposeful living.</p>

<h2>Love</h2>

<p>Once I understood the concept of Concupiscence, I started to understand myself and my captivity
to my desires. This lecture by Dr. R.J. Snell that was given at Princeton in February of 2020
provides a perspective on Concupiscence on how it compares to the other forms of love.</p>

<p><a href="https://soundcloud.com/thomisticinstitute/demons-at-the-feast-of-love-concupiscence-benevolence-and-transcendence">Demons at the Feast of Love: Concupiscence, Benevolence, and Transcendence</a></p>

<p>Speaking of forms of love, I have found it useful to be aware that love is not equal and love
is not just a feeling. Love, is verb, and in it's most ordered and good form is an act of 
giving of ones self to others. Love is not expecting to receive something. The ancient
Greeks knew this, we have all but forgot this: Eros, Filial, Agape (Benevolence).</p>

<p>Consider how the ending of the Gospel of John closes with our Lord's three time petition
of Peter's love. In <a href="https://www.drbo.org/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=21&l=16-#x">English</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>He saith to him again: Simon, son of John, lovest thou me? He saith to him:
  Yea, Lord, thou knowest that I love thee. He saith to him: Feed my lambs.
  He said to him the third time: Simon, son of John, lovest thou me? Peter was
  grieved, because he had said to him the third time: Lovest thou me? And he
  said to him: Lord, thou knowest all things: thou knowest that I love thee.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you look at the original <a href="https://biblehub.com/interlinear/john/21.htm">Greek of these words</a>
you will observe that this exchange involved different words for love throughout. In summary, it was like
this: the first and second petitions, Jesus asked with the word "Agapas", Peter responded with the word "Philo".
Here, Jesus asks Peter if he loves him in the highest form but Peter responds with a lower
form of love, that of a friend.</p>

<p>In the final petition, Jesus lowers His expectation and asks Peter with the word "Philo", matching
Peter's responses and showing mercy and acceptance to His apostle. </p>

<h2>Faith</h2>

<p>Ever hear anyone say, "I'm spiritual, but not religious". This lecture given at Yale in September
of 2021 by Dr. R.J. Snell provides invaluable insight into this chaotic ideology:</p>

<p>It is hard to argue with the logic presented by Blaise Pascal in
his discussion on the <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/pascal-wager/">"Belief in God Wager"</a>.</p>

<p>As someone who deals professionally in logic (<em>the digital kind</em>), I provide here my reflection
on faith in the light of reason and how religion, specifically Catholicism and it's intellectual tradition, is not unreasonable 
even for today's scientists, technologists, and engineers.</p>

<a data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#post_extended_1faf493dbaf020e1596f259bf5f3181f" style="color:#A00;text-decoration:underline">Continue reading...</a>
<div class="collapse hide" id="post_extended_1faf493dbaf020e1596f259bf5f3181f"><div class="card card-body">

<p>To summarize his treatise, a 2-bit binary truth table can be used:</p>

<h1>Pascal's Wager</h1>

<table class="table table-striped table-bordered table-sm center">
<thead>
<tr>
  <th style="text-align:center;">God's Existance</th>
  <th style="text-align:center;">My Belief in God and a Sincere Practice of His Tenets</th>
  <th style="text-align:left;">Result</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
  <td style="text-align:center;">0</td>
  <td style="text-align:center;">0</td>
  <td style="text-align:left;">No Effect</td>

<tr>
  <td style="text-align:center;">0</td>
  <td style="text-align:center;">1</td>

<tr>
  <td style="text-align:center;">1</td>
  <td style="text-align:center;">1</td>
  <td style="text-align:left;">Possible Salvation through Christ's Merits</td>

</tbody>
</table>

<p>By this logic, it is within reason to believe in God. Faith is not contrary to reason. To further develop
this idea we can turn to St. Thomas Aquinas and look at three mistakes that he cites when the
issue of Faith vs. Reason arises:</p>

<p>The 3 Mistakes:</p>

<ol>
<li>Skepticism - Says that faith is irrational because it cannot be proved. Or
science has disproved religion (somehow, there is no evidence of that
either).</li>
<li>Fideism - Agrees that faith is opposed to reason but affirms that faith is all you need.</li>
<li>Subjectivism - Faith is purely personal and interior</li>
</ol>

<p>St. Thomas argues that faith and reason are not in conflict because they are
both seeking a fundamental unity of truth based on the order of reality.</p>

<p>Cannot have something that is true according to faith and at the same time
false according to reason.</p>

<p>Truth is not subjective, private, or personal. Truth is based on reality.</p>

<p>When we derive truths from others, by trusting what they say, we rely on the
Signs of Credibility in their message. These signs show the rational marks that
allow us to accept the truth.</p>

<p>Because God is that fundamental Unity sought by faith and reason it only makes
sense that He is the source of reality (of all that exists).</p>

<p>Thus He must also then be the source of reason (and of faith and revelation).</p>

<p>But, How again do we /know/ that God is the source of reality?  By definition
of reason: God is not a created being, some “old man in the clouds“. God is
that which nothing can be greater: God <em>is</em> Love, God <em>is</em> Truth, God <em>is</em> Goodness.</p>

<p>By definition of faith: Per Aquinas and Catholic teaching, the church claims
that the signs of credibility are provided by examples such as Jesus’ miracles
and the enduring presence of the church through time.</p>

<p>So it must be up to us to accept these claimed signs of credibility and thus
accept them willfully as truths without any tangible proof. Thus we must have
faith in them. They are mysteries and cannot be proven by natural reason. </p>

<p>Is this reasonable, to accept that there is natural reason AND supernatural
reason (a.k.a the supernatural light of faith)?  … rather, is faith reasonable?</p>

<p>Faith may not be what you think it is. Consider how in physics, either
kinematics or energy models can be used to determine the end result of a physical
process: faith and reason can be viewed in this way as well. Both seek the same result. Both
employ similar mechanisms (thought). They just accomplish the same thing in
different ways. Similarly you cannot have one without the other because faith
without reason is blind and reason without faith is futile. So it seems that
faith is reasonable.</p>

<p>Why is reason without faith futile? Consider as an example that I have visited a city
far away and you have not. Would you have faith in my description of that city, would
you believe that the city exists or would you have to physically see everything for
yourself before you can make a determination? Faith in many ways, is necessary.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Understood this way, there is no opposition between the doctrine of creation
  ex nihilo and modern Big Bang cosmology. They examine the same reality from
  two different, non-competitive perspectives.” (<a href="https://aquinas101.thomisticinstitute.org/ne-faith-and-reason">ref</a>)</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“…truths which man can hope to know fully in the ultimate state of human perfection” (<a href="https://aquinas101.thomisticinstitute.org/selection-from-super-boetium-de-trinitat">ref</a>)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Induction: Can you label a claim as Truth and then explain it cannot be proven by natural reason?
“Look, there’s no way to prove it. Just trust me. Look at these other reasons why you should. Are those reasons not credible?”</p>

<p>Belief can be ascribed to an act of obedience to a higher authority.  It
requires an active and conscience decision of the will to accept the claims
that cannot be proven by natural reason.</p>

<p>Some truths can be known in this life but 5 reasons point to the necessity of faith:</p>

<ol>
<li>Eccles. 7:25 said: “It is a great depth, who shall find it out?” Thus, the depth and subtly of the claim may not make it apparent to us.</li>
<li>The human intellect is not perfect, compared with God, and we cannot comprehend all things.</li>
<li>Since divine truth is the “end” of all sciences, it would be necessary to understand all the sciences to understand the truth.</li>
<li>Due to man’s natural constitution, intellectual investigation is limited.</li>
<li>Because man is too busy trying to stay alive, and their lives are short,
they would be unable to learn everything required to understand all things.</li>
</ol>

<p>So the claim here is that Faith is a replacement for these limitations. Is. 7:9 said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Unless thou hadst believed, thou wouldst not understand.”</p>
